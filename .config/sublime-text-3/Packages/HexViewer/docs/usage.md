### Hex Viewer: Toggle Hex View
Toggles file in or out of hex view.

### Hex Viewer: Show Hex Inspector
Show the Hex Inspector panel.  The Hex Inspector is a panel which shows the current selected byte as different unit types.

| Name        | Signed   | Bits |
|-------------|----------|------|
| Byte        | Unsigned | 8    |
| Short       | Signed   | 8    |
| Word        | Unsigned | 16   |
| Int         | Signed   | 16   |
| Dword       | Unsigned | 32   |
| LongInt     | Signed   | 32   |
| Qword       | Unsinged | 64   |
| LongLongInt | Signed   | 64   |
| Float       | Signed   | 32   |
| Double      | Signed   | 64   |
| Binary      | NA       | 8    |

### Hex Viewer: Toggle Endiannes (Big|Little)
Toggles the parsing of bytes to big or little endian when showing unit types in Hex Inspector.

### Hex Viewer: Set Bits Per Group
Allows selection from the quick panel the grouping of bytes by 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 bits.  This will reload the file with this formatting.  All edits will be lost, so export your changes before you do this.

### Hex Viewer: Set Bytes Per Line
Allows selection from the quick panel the number of bytes to be shown on a line (allowed options are defined in [valid_bytes_per_line](#valid_bytes_per_line)).

### Hex Viewer: Find By Address
Finds the byte at the specified address.  Input is received through the input panel.

### Hex Viewer: Show Hex Edit Panel
Invoking this command will take the currently selected bytes on a line and display them in an input panel.  They can then be modified and submitted to replace the original bytes.  Strings can also be used by using the `s:` prefix followed by the equivalent ASCII characters that are to replace the selected bytes.

### Hex Viewer: Discard All Edits
If at any time you would like to discard all of the changes you have currently made to the hex view, you can invoke this command and a clean hex view will be reloaded.

### Hex Viewer: Export Bin
Exports the current hex view to a binary file.

### Hex Viewer: Run Checksum
By default, it opens up a quick panel with all available hashes that can be used as a checksum.  When an algorithm is selected, it is used to retrieve the checksum for the current file in hex view mode.

### Hex Viewer: Generate Hash
Shows a quick panel allowing you to select the desired hash, and then shows an input panel that allows you to specify the string to be hashed. A panel is then displayed with your generated hash according to the selected specifications.

### Hex Viewer: Generate Hash from Selection
Allows you to generate hashes from your current selection(s).  Multi-select regions' content will be combined and evaluated together.  If a region contains newlines, they will be hashed as well.

### Hex Viewer: Abort (Hex Conversion|Export|Checksum)
Abort the given action.

### Hex Viewer: Open in External Viewer
Opens the current binary file in an external hex editor.

## Configurable settings
Settings are configurable in the `hex_viewer.sublime-settings` file.

### group_bytes_by_bits
Groups together the bytes by the number of bits.  Valid numbers are must be divisible by bytes and currently go up to 128 bits.

```js

    // Group bytes together by bits
    // Valid Settings (8|16|32|64|128)
    "group_bytes_by_bits" : 16,
```

### valid_bytes_per_line
Sets the number of valid bytes that will be allowed for the `valid_bytes_per_line`.  Keep in mind though that just be because a value is deemed valid here, there are still some restriction that are covered in [bytes_per_line](#bytes_per_line).

```js
    // These are the valid bytes per line options
    "valid_bytes_per_line" : [8, 10, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256, 512],
```

### bytes_per_line
Number of bytes that will be shown on a line.  Can be any value found in [valid_bytes_per_line](#valid_bytes_per_line).  Even if the value is valid, there are some things to be aware of. HexViewer will default to a more reasonable value if the following does not hold true **bytes_per_line / (group_bytes_by_bits / 8) == 0**; if this does not hold true, there will be an adjustment made to the final number of bytes per line.

```js
    // Number of 8 bit bytes per line.
    // See "valid_bytes_per_line" for valid options
    "bytes_per_line" : 24,
```

### custom_font
Sets the font used in a HexViewer view.  It is strongly recommended to set this to a monospaced font if your default font is not monospaced.

```js
    // Use None to use the current Sublime Text font.
    "custom_font" : "none",
```

### custom_font_size
Sets the font size to be used in a HexViewer view.

```js
    // Use zero to use the current Sublime Text font size.
    "custom_font_size" : 0,
```

### inspector
Sets whether the Hex Inspector panel is enabled.  To have the Hex Inspector panel auto-open when a HexViewer view loads, see [inspector_auto_show](#inspector_auto_show).

```js
    // Show inspector panel
    "inspector" : true,
```

### inspector_endian
Sets the endianness of the displayed values in the inspector.  The string value of `big` and `little` can be used.

```js
    // endian? (big|little)
    "inspector_endian" : "big",
```

### inspector_auto_show
Sets whether the Hex Inspector panel will auto-show on HexViewer view load.  If this is disabled, the Hex Inspector panel can still be shown manually when desired.

```js
    // Show inspector panel on hex view load and hide on hex view hide
    "inspector_auto_show" : true,
```

### inspector_integer_format
Controls the text format for integer output in the inspector panel.  Uses standard python string formatting.

```js
   // Inspector format strings: ints and unsigned ints
    "inspector_integer_format": "%-12s:  %-22d",
```

### inspector_float_format
Controls the text format for float output in the inspector panel.  Uses standard python string formatting.

```js
    // Inspector format strings: floating point decimals
    "insepctor_float_format": "%-12s:  %-22e",
```

### inspector_double_format
Controls the text format for double output in the inspector panel.  Uses standard python string formatting.

```js
    // Inspector format strings: double floating point decimal strings
    "inspector_double_format": "%-12s:  %-22e",
```

### inspector_missing/bad_format
Controls the text format for missing/bad output in the inspector panel.  Uses standard python string formatting.

```js
    // Inspector format strings: "NAN" and not enough bytes to show numbers "--"
    "inspector_missing/bad_format": "%-12s:  %-22s",
```

### inspector_binary_format
Controls the text format for binary output in the inspector panel.  Uses standard python string formatting.

```js
    // Binary number formatting
    "inspector_binary_format": "%-12s:  %-22s"
```

### enable_fake_hex_file
When loading a file that is a HexViewer visual representation of a binary file, and the syntax is set to HexViewer's custom syntax, HexViewer will enable basic byte highlight features, Hex Inspector panel etc.

```js 
    // Treat files in hex syntax with proper format
    // (usually .hex files; saved versions of hex output)
    // as real hex views.  The following functionality will be omitted:
    // hex toggle, editing, writing to file,
    // and dynamic changing of bits and bytes functionality.
    // Address searching, Hex inspector, etc. should work fine.
    "enable_fake_hex_file": true,
```

### highlight_max_bytes
Sets the max number of allowed bytes that HexViewer will highlight when selected.  This is a setting that limits the highlight for the sake of performance.  Keep this set to a reasonable value.

```js
    // Approximate max byte selection.
    // The highlighter will highlight individual selections until
    // the max number of bytes is found.  The selection containing
    // the maximum byte will still be finished even if it has more
    // bytes than the max.
    "highlight_max_bytes" : 1000,
```

### highlight_throttle
Sets whether `highlight_max_bytes` will be used.  This allows a user to not limit the number of highlighted bytes.  It is not recommended to use this for performances sake.

```js
    //Enable highlight throttling
    "highlight_throttle" : false,
```

### highlight_scope
Define the highlight color when a byte or ASCII char is selected.  Colors must be a scope found in your theme file, if not, the color will be the default font color.

```js
    // Scope? (Defined in theme files.)
    // Examples: (keyword|string|number)
    "highlight_scope" : "string",
```

### highlight_scope
Define the highlight color for bytes that have been edited.  Colors must be a scope found in your theme file, if not, the color will be the default font color.

```js
    "highlight_edit_scope": "keyword",
```

### highlight_icon
Sets a gutter icon for highlighted bytes.  Default is set to the string `none` to hide the icon.  This can be changed to either `dot`, `circle`, `bookmark`, `cross`, or `none`.

```js
    // Icon? (dot|circle|bookmark|cross|none)
    "highlight_icon" : "none",
```

### highlight_edit_icon
Sets a gutter icon for edited bytes.  Default is set to the string `none` to hide the icon.  This can be changed to either `dot`, `circle`, `bookmark`, `cross`, `none`.

```js
    "highlight_edit_icon" : "none",
```

### highlight_style
Sets the highlight style for highlighted bytes.  Can be `solid`, `outline`, `underline`, or `none`.

```js
    // Style? (solid|outline|underline|none)
    "highlight_style" : "solid",
```

### highlight_edit_style
Sets the highlight style for edited bytes.  Can be `solid`, `outline`, `underline`, or `none`.

```js
    "highlight_edit_style" : "underline",
```

### max_file_size_kb
Sets a limit for how big of a binary file HexViewer will try and convert to a HexView.  Size is in Kilobytes.

```js
    // Maximum allowed byte size that HexViewer will parse
    "max_file_size_kb": 50000.0,
```

### external_viewer
Sometimes it may be desired to open a hex view in an external editor.  HexViewer, due to the nature of the Sublime Text API is limited in certain ways, so it can be advantageous to open a file in an external hex editor for certain files or certain tasks.  `external_viewer` allows the configuring of the external hex editor.  `external_viewer` is a dictionary containing to parameters.  `viewer`, which is an absolute bath the the external hex editor.  `args` are the arguments that will be passed to the external editor; it is an array of string arguments.  You can use `${FILE}` has a place holder for the file path that will be sent to the editor.  HexViewer will insert the actual file path in the place of `${FILE}`.

```js
    // External Hex Viewer if max size is exceeded.
    // Viewer should be the absolute path.
    // Args is an array of command line arguments. Use ${FILE} for the file path.
    "external_viewer": {
        "viewer": "",
        "args": ["${FILE}"]
    },
```

### hash_algorithm
The default checksum algorithm to use when creating a hash or checksum (not all values listed below will be found on every platform and system).

```js
    // Checksum algorithm default? (the default is what is applied to a file when saving)
    // (mdc2|md4|md5|sha|sha1|sha224|sha256|sha384|sha512|ripemd160|crc32|adler32)
    "hash_algorithm" : "md5",
```

### checksum_on_save
Controls whether HexViewer will checksum the binary file on save/export.

```js
    // Enable checksum on save
    "checksum_on_save" : true,
```

### auto_open
Sets whether HexViewer should auto detect binary files and convert them to HexViewer views.  When enabled, HexViewer will detect when a view is set to the `Hexidecimal` syntax, or if the file name matches the [auto_open_patterns](#auto_open_patterns) found below.

```js
    // Auto open binary files in hex viewer
    // Detects if view has encoding set to 'Hexidecimal'.
    // Additionally it can use 'auto_open_patterns' below.
    "auto_open" : false,
```

### auto_open_patterns
When [auto_open](#auto_open) is enabled, HexViewer will use the following list of file patterns to detect binary files for auto conversion.

```js
    // Auto open patterns to open in hex viewer
    "auto_open_patterns" : ["*.bin", "*.pyc"],
```

### disable_auto_open_hex_encoding
Sets whether [auto_open](#auto_open) will convert views with the `Hexidecimal` syntax.

```js
    // Disable auto open based on 'Hexidecimal' encoding
    "disable_auto_open_hex_encoding": false,
```

### use_sub_notify
Enables use of [SubNotify](https://github.com/facelessuser/SubNotify) notifications.

```js
    // Use sub notify if available
    "use_sub_notify": true,
```
